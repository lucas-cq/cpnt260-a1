### When Problem's Arrised
My biggest problem during this assignment was flexbox. I did not understand how it worked until I took a step back.
I finally began to understand it once I inspected my page in FireFox. I saw the margins, and saw how flexbox turned my basic
boxes into an ordered structure.
